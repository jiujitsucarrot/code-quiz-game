# 04 Quiz Game

## Your Task
At some point in your journey to become a full-stack web developer, you’ll likely be asked to complete a coding assessment—perhaps as part of an interview process. A typical coding assessment includes both multiple-choice questions and interactive coding challenges. 

To help familiarize you with these tests and allow you to use the skills covered in this module, this Challenge invites you to build a timed coding quiz with multiple-choice questions. This app will run in the browser and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean, polished, and responsive user interface. 

This week’s coursework will equip you with all the skills you need to succeed in this assignment.

## Objective

In this challenge the objectives are the following.


## User Story

```
AS A coding boot camp student
I WANT to take a timed quiz on JavaScript fundamentals that stores high scores
SO THAT I can gauge my progress compared to my peers
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Series of Events

This challenge has been the most challenging and frustrating by far. Unfortunately the code is incomplete. I wasn't able to fufill all the acceptance criteria yet. But will be re-submitting once final logic has been implemented and completed. With that being said I began with wire framing my thoughts for the project as well as layout and the functionality of the quiz game. I referred back to my notes, past projects, and YouTube for ideas on how to structure the game. Once the structure was implemented I began working on the logic. Making things like the start button clickable, starting the quiz, a running timer once the start button is hit and the quiz begins as well as a 6 second penalty for incorrect submissions, generate questions, etc. The page will return an alert of correct or incorrect depending on your answer as well. I have hit a wall when it comes to running through all 5 question options. Not to mention still needing to end the quiz, save scores, then store the scores in local storage. I still have quite a bit to complete with the two HTML and JavaScript docs but will re-submit as soon as completed.


## Sources

In this challenge utilizing JavaScript further to attempt to generate a quiz game. For further assistance to develop the best application I could I revisited course lectures, notes, reached out to classmates and colleagues, YouTube tutorials, MDN, Google, JavaScript for Dummies, reached out to the class TA's, spent time going over the challenge with my tutor. Anything that I could to help me navigate through this week's challenge.
